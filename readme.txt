Do you have many users on your WordPress site? Look them up fast by indexing them in your metadata. Eliminate slow loading on Users, Posts, and Pages panels in your dashboard.

== Description ==

WordPress sites with many users slow down drastically, especially on Dashboard pages. It can take many seconds each time you display your Users dashboard panel. It takes just about the same large amount of time to display your Posts or Pages panels. While those slow displays are loading, WordPress is hammering on your site's MySQL or MariaDB database server. That means your site serves your visitors slowly too, not just your dashboard users.

And, versions of WordPress since 6.0.1 have dealt with (this performance problem)[https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/38741] by preventing changes to the authors of posts and pages in the Gutenberg editor, the classic editor, and the Quick Edit feature. Those versions also suppress the user counts shown at the top of the Users panel.

This plugin helps speed up the handling of those large numbers of users. It does so by indexing your users by adding metadata that's easily optimized by MySQL or MariaDB. For example, when your site must ask the database for your post-author users, the database no longer needs to examine every user on your system. (In database jargon, it no longer needs to do a notoriously slow full table scan.)

When slow queries are required to make sure the metadata indexes are up to date, this plugin does them in the background so nobody has to wait for them to complete. You can set the plugin to do this background work at a particular time each day. Many people prefer to do them overnight or at some other off-peak time.

You can also configure the Author pulldown menu under Quick Edit on your Posts and Pages panels to be easier to use when you have a large numbers of Editors, Authors, or Contributors on your site. You can show the most prolific authors first, and you can limit the number of choices in the pulldown menu.

This is a companion plugin to [Index WP MySQL for Speed](https://wordpress.org/plugins/index-wp-mysql-for-speed/). If that plugin is in use, this plugin will perform better. But they are in no way dependent on one another; you may use either, both, or of course neither.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Should I back up my site before using this? =

**Yes.** Backups are good practice. Still, this plugin makes no changes to your site or database layout. It adds a few non-autoloaded options, and adds rows to wp_usermeta.

= My WordPress host offers MariaDB, not MySQL. Can I use this plugin?

**Yes.**

= I have a multi-site WordPress installation. Can I use this plugin?

**Yes.**

= I see high CPU usage (load average) on my MariaDB / MySQL database server during user index building or refresh. Is that normal?

**Yes.** Indexing your registered users requires us to insert a row in wp_usermeta for each of them. We do this work in batches of 1000 users to avoid locking up your MariaDB / MySQL server. Each batch takes server time. Once all the batches of index building or refresh are complete, your CPU usage will return to normal.

= Can I use this if I have disabled WP_Cron and use an operating system cronjob instead?

**Yes, as of Version 1.0.2 and higher.**

= How does it work? (Geeky!) =

Standard WordPress puts a `wp_capabilities` row in the `wp_usermeta` table for each user. Its `meta_value` contains a small data structure. For example, an author has this data structure.

`array("author")`

In order to find all the authors WordPress must issue a database query containing a filter like this one, that starts and ends with the SQL wildcard character `%`.

`meta_key = 'wp_capabilities' AND meta_value LIKE '%"author"%'`

Filters like that are notoriously slow: they cannot exploit any database keys, and so MySQL or MariaDB must examine that `wp_usermeta` row for every user in your site.

This plugin adds rows to `wp_usermeta` describing each user in a way that's easier to search.  To find authors, the plugin uses this much faster filter instead.

`meta_key = 'wp_index_wp_users_for_speed_role_author'`

It takes a while to insert these extra indexing rows into the database; that happens in the background.

Once the indexing rows are in place, you can add, delete, or change user roles without regenerating those rows: the plugin maintains them.
